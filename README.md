# FINM 32700 1 (Spring 2024) - Advanced Computing for Finance

## I – Course Description

This course aims to teach programming concepts and techniques necessary for students desiring to work in the financial sector. By the end of the class, students will have acquired the programming skills essential for their daily activities in roles such as quantitative researchers. The curriculum covers advanced data structures (STL, Boost), parallel programming, inter-process communication, linear algebra computation, simulation, and modeling. Through various projects, students will build trading strategies using C++. Teaching methods include a combination of lectures and in-class hands-on lab sessions.

## II – Objectives

After completing this course, students should be able to:

- Code advanced C++ code
- Handle unit testing to ensure code reliability
- Understand the design of a trading system and the microstructure of the market
- Use math libraries for advanced calculations
- Write high-frequency trading code using Boost and STL libraries

## III - Course Organization

The course includes weekly lectures and optional TA sessions. Attendance in class is strongly encouraged despite recorded sessions. The coursework primarily revolves around programming assignments, culminating in a final exam.

### Grading

- Weekly Programming assignments: 20%
- Course Project: 20%
- Midterm Exam: 25%
- Final Exam: 30%
- Participation: 5%

#### Late Submission

Late submissions will receive prorated points based on the number of late days:

- 1 day late: 75% of the grade
- 2 days late: 50% of the grade
- 3 days late: 25% of the grade
- After 3 days: No submissions accepted

## IV - Exam

The midterm and final exams will be conducted on-site, with the final exam being open-book and covering the entire class content. Both exams will include coding questions related to lecture content and the project.

## V - Programming Assignments

Simple written problems will be assigned at the end of each lecture, due the following week, to deepen understanding of the course material.

## VI - Class Project

An individual class project will be assigned, aiming to develop your own trading strategy, contributing significantly to the course grade.
